# NumPy

Welcome to my NumPy learning repo! This space is where I practice core NumPy skills as I build my data science and machine learning foundations.

This repository contains beginner-level exercises that focus **only on NumPy**. Each file is designed to help reinforce key NumPy concepts like arrays, matrices, indexing, and numerical operations.

These exercises are part of my journey to become a machine learning engineer. If youâ€™re learning too - feel free to fork this repo or suggest improvements!
